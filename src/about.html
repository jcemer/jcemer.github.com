    <p>I started learning a few HTML tags and now I have a <a href="http://inf.ufrgs.br" target="_blank">Computer Science degree</a> and work at Uber.</p>
    <p>I have been coding Internet products since 2006. On my first job, I was coding PHP and after a while became one of the founders of Cure, a digital agency. I've been working on the front-end and back-end since then.</p>
    <p>I did many projects and joined <a href="http://gri.fo" target="_blank">Grifo</a> as Lead Developer mainly working with front-end. I also worked with Ruby on Rails at Codeminer, an outsourcing company.</p> 
    <p>Most recently, I worked at <a href="http://globo.com">Globo.com</a>, the Internet branch of the biggest media group in Brazil, and <a href="https://work.co">Work&Co</a>.</p>
    <p>Right now, I'm shipping code at Uber.</p>

    <p>I combine <strong>passion and science</strong> in my projects. I solve real world problems by writing code with the best practices, context related technologies, and metrics. I like to learn new languages, libraries and processes. I believe that <strong>communication</strong> is the main ingredient to achieve results.</p>
