    <p>I started learning some HTML tags and now I have a <a href="http://inf.ufrgs.br" target="_blank">Computer Science graduation</a>. I have been making Internet products since 2006.</p>
    <p>On my first job, I wrote PHP. After a while, I was one of the founders of Cure, a Digital Agency. I've been turning myself into a fullstack developer since then. I did many projects and became a front-end specialist as Lead Developer at <a href="http://gri.fo" target="_blank">Grifo</a>.</p>
    <p>I have spent a good time developing Ruby on Rails applications at Codeminer, a outsourcing company. I worked for a while on a start-up with a mobile product. I also worked at <a href="http://globo.com">Globo.com</a>, an Internet branch of a huge media group in Brazil.</p>
    <p>I'm currently crafting code at <a href="http://work.co" target="_blank">Work&amp;Co</a>.</p>

    <p>I combine <strong>passion and science</strong> in my projects. I write code with best practices and context related technologies to solve real world problems (measuring it). I like to learn new languages, libraries and processes. I believe that <strong>communication</strong> is the main ingredient to achieve results.</p>
